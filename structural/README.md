# Structural Patterns
Structural patterns provide a manner to define relationships between classes or objects.
## [Adapter](./adapter)
The adapter pattern is used to provide a link between two otherwise incompatible types by wrapping the "adaptee" with a class that supports the interface required by the client.
## [Bridge](./bridge)
The bridge pattern is used to separate the abstract elements of a class from the implementation details, providing the means to replace the implementation details without modifying the abstraction.
## [Composite](./composite)
The composite pattern is used to create hierarchical, recursive tree structures of related objects where any element of the structure may be accessed and utilised in a standard manner.
## [Decorator](./decorator)
The decorator pattern is used to extend or alter the functionality of objects at run-time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class. This provides a flexible alternative to using inheritance to modify behaviour.
## [Facade](./facade)
The facade pattern is used to define a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem.
## [Flyweight](./flyweight)
The flyweight pattern is used to reduce the memory and resource usage for complex models containing many hundreds, thousands or hundreds of thousands of similar objects.
## [Proxy](./proxy)
The proxy pattern is used to provide a surrogate or placeholder object, which references an underlying object. The proxy provides the same public interface as the underlying subject class, adding a level of indirection by accepting requests from a client object and passing these to the real subject object as necessary.
