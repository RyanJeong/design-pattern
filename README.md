## Creational Patterns
Creational patterns provide ways to instantiate single objects or groups of related objects. There are five such patterns:
* [Abstract Factory](./creational/abstract-factory)
* [Builder](./creational/builder)
* [Factory Method](./creational/factory-method)
* [Prototype](./creational/prototype)
* [Singleton](./creational/singleton)
