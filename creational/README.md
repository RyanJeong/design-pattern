# Creational Patterns
Creational patterns provide ways to instantiate single objects or groups of related objects.
## [Abstract Factory](./abstract-factory)
The abstract factory pattern is used to provide a client with a set of related or dependant objects. The "family" of objects created by the factory are determined at run-time.
## [Builder](./builder)
The builder pattern is used to create complex objects with constituent parts that must be created in the same order or using a specific algorithm. An external class controls the construction algorithm.
## [Factory Method](./factory-method)
The factory pattern is used to replace class constructors, abstracting the process of object generation so that the type of the object instantiated can be determined at run-time.
## [Prototype](./prototype)
The prototype pattern is used to instantiate a new object by copying all of the properties of an existing object, creating an independent clone. This practise is particularly useful when the construction of a new object is inefficient.
## [Singleton](./singleton)
The singleton pattern ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created. All further references to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance.
